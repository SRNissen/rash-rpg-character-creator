make character creator for DnD with simplified rules in a way that is theoretically extensible to other editions and other games (e.g. sf's game)

business logic:
    - probably in main.js
        - load a list of (RPG) classes from files
        - implement rules of DND character creation/ other game?
            -maybe do two super simple RPGs first and then add DND/ real games later
        - switch to which game to load rules for

UI:
    - pick which game's ruleset
    - design the UI
